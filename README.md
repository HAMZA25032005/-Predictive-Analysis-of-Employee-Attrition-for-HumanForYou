# 📊 **Predictive Analysis of Employee Attrition for HumanForYou** 🔍

## 📝 **Description**

This project addresses the issue of employee attrition at **HumanForYou**, a company facing a 15% annual turnover rate. The high attrition rate negatively impacts project timelines and increases recruitment and training costs.

The goal of this project is to **predict employee attrition** by identifying the key factors contributing to turnover and proposing actionable solutions to enhance retention strategies. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle, and multiple machine learning algorithms are employed to develop a predictive model for employee attrition.

## 📁 **Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is the [HR Analytics Case Study dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/hr-analytics-case-study/data) from Kaggle. It contains data related to employee information, including demographic details, job satisfaction, salary, and attrition status.

## 🔄 **Project Workflow**

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing** 🔧  
   - Data cleaning: Handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.  
   - Encoding categorical variables.  
   - Merging multiple datasets using a common identifier.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍  
   - Visualizing and understanding the distribution of key variables.  
   - Identifying correlations between variables.

3. **Modeling** 🤖  
   - Applying multiple machine learning models, including:
     - **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**  
     - **Perceptron**  
     - **Random Forest**  
     - **Decision Tree**
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

4. **Model Evaluation & Selection** 🏆  
   - Comparing the results of each model to choose the most effective one for predicting employee attrition.

5. **Results & Insights** 💡  
   - Providing actionable insights to improve employee retention and reduce turnover.
